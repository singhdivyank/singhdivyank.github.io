              Divyank is a result oriented Data Scientist. 
              His contributions to many projects received client testimony and 
              improved our customer service experience. 
              As his manager, I was impressed with his work ethic and professionalism. 
              He showed a good attitude towards exploring the fundamentals of involved algorithms 
              and fostered a culture of knowledge sharing within the organization by involving 
              the team with latest research. He possesses a unique quality of being approachable 
              and willingness to assist on tasks outside his immediate expertise

              One of the bright interns I have worked with!

              I mentored Divyank during at Sabudh foundation. He
              acquired a very good understanding of deep learning. He
              demonstrated good understanding of Recommendation Engines and text
              analytics and has a good hold of various NLP techniques. Apart
              from technical skills he has excellent communication skills and I
              would give my strongest recommendation for roles which require
              intelligence, organization and a positive attitude

              Of all the people I meet every day only some leave their mark and
              Divyank is one of them. We collaborated for a research publication
              to forecast COVID-19 infestimations and estimate the extent of the
              pandemic; initially we were on different pages however he got us
              on board with exceptional ideas. He exhibited great maturity and
              discipline while carrying out various responsibilities such as
              surveying research papers, developing a prediction model in Python
              and documenting the research findings on Overleaf. For his
              pristine work ethics and adjustability to given situations I give
              him my highest recommendation to anyone looking for a Data Science
              professional.
