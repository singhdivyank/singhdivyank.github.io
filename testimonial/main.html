              I mentored Divyank during his internship at Sabudh foundation. He
              acquired a very good understanding of deep learning. He
              demonstrated good understanding of Recommendation Engines and text
              analytics and has a good hold of various NLP techniques. Apart
              from technical skills he has excellent communication skills and I
              would give my strongest recommendation for roles which require
              intelligence, organization and a positive attitude

              Divyank is undoubtedly a rare talent. Of all the people you meet every day only some leave their mark and he is one of them. We collaborated for a research publication initially we were on different pages however he got us on board with exceptional ideas. I was in awe of how he managed to consistently keep us on the same page and avoid conflict enabling us to focus on the deliverables. He exhibited great maturity while carrying out various responsibilities such as surveying numerous research papers, developing a prediction model using Python, documented the publication on Overleaf and showed excellent technical knowledge about Machine Learning concepts. As a teammate, Divyank earns my highest recommendation.
